        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Rosa Lee Carter was born in Bluemont, Virginia. She earned her BA in elementary education from Storer College in West Virginia. She began her long teaching career in Loudoun at Powell's Grove in 1927. She then taught at Grant School in Middleburg, Virginia in the 1930's. Her first impression of teaching school was not a pleasant one. She noted that the disparities between black and white schools were to be a great challenge. She taught in adverse conditions, such as cold overcrowded classrooms, no water, leaky roofs and a lack of funds for books and necessities.<br><br><br><br>

                    <p> Spelling bees are the most well-known spelling competitions which take place all over the world. Even though they are essentially designed for children, most adults would struggle with some of the words which the lovely young contestants have to deal with in these competitions. Winning a spelling bee is hard, but not impossible.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal"> live in Leesburg, VA and graduated elementary, middle, and high school here in Loudoun County. I attended James Madison University where I received my B.S. in Interdisciplinary Liberal Studies and my Masters of Arts in Teaching. I completed my student teaching in Loudoun County at Ballâ€™s Bluff Elementary School in 2nd and 3rd grade. I have also completed practicum experiences in Kindergarten, 4th and 5th grades in Harrisonburg, VA. At JMU, I was involved in Big Brothers Big Sisters for four years, which continues to impact my life in many ways. I was fortunate to study abroad for a month in Orotina, Costa Rica where I lived with a Spanish-speaking host family, went on different excursions exploring the country, and got to spend time in an elementary school.<br> <a href="https://www.lcps.org/Page/206609"><b>RLC page link</b></a> </p>
